### Hello There üåé
 
I'm Alan Cruz, a graduate <strong>Full Stack Software Developer</strong> Diploma program from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma-uk/) based in Ireland. Currently.

Passionate <strong>Full Stack Software Developer</strong> in progress with a background in Business Administration, HR (Human Resources) and Accounting. 

After many years, I've finally found what I wish I had been doing all along - Better late than never!

I found the right path after realising I was always being asked to pick up the more technical aspects of projects and enjoyed carrying them out. I've always liked technology, design and always learning new skills.

<em>So here I am, learning everything I can right now, figuring out the problems as I go and looking forward to the new world ahead.</em>

### Hackathon Projects

Participating in my first hackathon had me on edge, but, was it a ride! Snagged third place and loved every minute of collaborating with fellow hackers under tight deadlines, using sprints and agile methods. It's pure adrenaline and totally worth it!
